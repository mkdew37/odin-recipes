This is the first project with Odin!

Just a basic recipe site with a index page and 3 linked recipe pages containing instructions on how to make the dish.

In this project I have learnt the basics of writing HTML, make proper links and adding photos. Also added some breaks in the text due to a bit long lines of text here and there. Also tried to tiding up the files to make it look more appealing.
